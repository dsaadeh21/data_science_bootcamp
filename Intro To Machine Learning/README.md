- 'minutes' — total call duration in minutes,
- 'messages' — number of text messages,
- 'mb_used' — Internet traffic used in MB,
- 'is_ultra' — plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0).

# Goal 
- Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
