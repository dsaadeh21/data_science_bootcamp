# Project description
- Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. 
- To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.
- The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.

# Data description
The data is stored in the /datasets/taxi.csv file. Download the dataset.
The number of orders is in the num_orders column.

# Goal
- Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset.
- Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.
